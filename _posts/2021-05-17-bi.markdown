I experimented with reinforcement learning as a basis for learning bipedal locomotive skills from human demonstrations, using data from the [CMU Motion Capture Database](http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/) as the demonstration source and the [NASA Valkyrie (R5) robot](https://sites.utexas.edu/hcrl/files/2016/01/jfr-nasa-hcrl-final.pdf) as the target system for motion imitation. This work draws from [*Peng at al. 2020*](https://xbpeng.github.io/projects/Robotic_Imitation/index.html) and [*Xie et al. 2019*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.09537.pdf).
