We propose that long-context LMs for decision-making, interaction, and/or world-modeling be trained on demonstration data consisting of textual observation deltas, or *diff history*. Diff history can be thought of as a **textual analogue of optical flow**. Using diff history, we show that even tiny LMs (~120M parameters) can be efficiently tuned into highly competitive and robust agents for hard decision-making settings like the video-game NetHack, where they match state-of-the-art despite being tuned on 1800x fewer data than prior work.
