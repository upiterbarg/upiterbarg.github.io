I worked with <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~k2smith/">Kevin A. Smith</a> and <a href="https://web.mit.edu/krallen/www/">Kelsey R. Allen</a> to design and to run a preliminary study testing the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/virtualtoolsgame/home">Virtual Tools Game</a> as a testbed for behavioral experiments studying abstract strategy learning in humans. I also designed a hierarchical Bayesian mixture model to identify the abstract strategies learned by study participants directly from data.
