I co-designed the prototype of an anamorphic entrance sculpture to the American Museum of Natural History special exhibition "<a href="https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/our-senses-an-immersive-experience">Our Senses: An Immersive Experience</a>." The final sculpture was included in the <em>New York Times</em> feature on the exhibition, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/23/arts/design/our-senses-exhibition-american-museum-of-natural-history.html">"This Exhibition Will Help You Make Sense of Your Senses"</a>.
