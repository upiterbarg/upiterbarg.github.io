This project revolves around a simple extension of the classical SIR compartmental model of disease transmission that parameterizes infection-based social distancing policy i.e., the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13216.pdf">feedback SIR (fSIR)</a> model imagined by <a href="https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/elisa-franco/">Dr. Elisa Franco</a>. I fit this model via the probabilistic programming package <a href="https://docs.pymc.io/">PyMC3</a> against true statistics of infection from four countries with sharply-contrasting responses to the pandemic, yielding posteriors that made it possible to perform a rough numerical comparison of policy-efficacy.
