Supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=nZ0m0xUAAAAJ&hl=de">Johanni Brea</a> and <a href="https://lcnwww.epfl.ch/gerstner/">Wulfram Gerstner</a>, I investigated the efficacy of option-conditional value prediction in reinforcement learning (RL) by adapting the <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/file/ffbd6cbb019a1413183c8d08f2929307-Paper.pdf">Value Prediction Network</a> for tabular environments as well as by implementing the algorithm as in Oh et al.â€™s original paper, using a combination of temporal-difference search (TD search) and n-step Q-learning for training.
