What do people learn when they repeatedly try to solve a set of
related problems? In a set of three different exploratory physical problem solving experiments, participants consistently learn strategies rather than generically better world models. Our results suggested that people can make use of limited experience to learn abstract strategies that go beyond simple model-free policies and are instead object-oriented, adaptable, and can be parameterized by model-based variables such as weight.
