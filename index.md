## About

I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the [CILVR lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/) at [NYU Courant](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/), co-advised by [Rob Fergus](https://cs.nyu.edu/~fergus/pmwiki/pmwiki.php) and [Lerrel Pinto](https://www.lerrelpinto.com/). My research interests include <b>representation learning</b>, <b>differentiable computing</b>, <b>intuitive physics</b>, and <b>reinforcement learning</b>. I'm fortunate to be supported by a DeepMind Ph.D. Fellowship and a [National Science Foundation GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/resources/about-grfp/) award.


Previously, I majored in [math](https://math.mit.edu/academics/undergrad/major/course18c.php) at MIT. During my undergrad, I did research on the cognitive bases of physical strategy learning in humans with the MIT Computational Cognitive Science Group, advised by <a href="https://web.mit.edu/krallen/www/">Kelsey R. Allen</a> and <a href="https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/people/joshua-tenenbaum/">Josh Tenenbaum</a>, and on neural partial differential equations for accelerating climate models with the  <a href="https://clima.caltech.edu/">Climate Modeling Alliance</a>, advised by <a href="https://sandreza.github.io/">Andre N. Souza</a> and <a href="http://ferrari.mit.edu/">Raffaele Ferrari</a>. I also spent wonderful summers as a [SV SRP](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sv/education/summer-research-program/) student in [Wulfram Gerstner](https://lcnwww.epfl.ch/gerstner/)'s group at EPFL and as a Ph.D. research intern in [Michael P. Brenner](https://research.google/people/106803/)'s group at Google Research.
