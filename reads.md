## Words of Wisdom

Here are a few thoughts from some of my personal heroes.

<i> "You can do it, only you can do it, you can't do it alone."

<p class="quote">
<i>"The next great era of awakening of human intellect may well produce a method of understanding the qualitative content of equations. Today we cannot. Today we cannot see that the water flow equations contain such things as the barber pole structure of turbulence that one sees between rotating cylinders. Today we cannot see whether Schrodinger's equation contains frogs, musical composers, or morality -- or whether it does not."</i>
